Optimise the calls to Smalltalk.instance() so they are done once per method
or set of statements.

Change runtime exception when selector not understood with send of DNU.

Add command line parameter to turn on/off tracing.

Add command line parameter to indicate where source files can be found.
This path will be subtracted from the path of input source files to form
the class name. eg: src/test/smalltalk/Test.st with a source file path of
'src/test/' will be seen as the Class Test in the namespace 'smalltalk'

Refactor class loading / resolving functionality out of Smalltalk class.
