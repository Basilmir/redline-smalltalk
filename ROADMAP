- Redline Smalltalk feature ROADMAP -

-- Version 1.0 --

Goal: Provide a base that can be used for developing tools or applications without a UI in Smalltalk to be run on the Java Virtual Machine.

001. Smalltalk Compiler
     
    A compiler that supports the full Smalltalk language, compiling both classes and scripts (files without classes) into JVM bytecode for execution.

    The compiler should output debug information such that JVM debuggers can set break points and debug the code line by line. The debug information
    should also be included in exceptions to show which Smalltalk source lines were involved in any exceptions.

    The compiler should handle the dispatch of control to primitive methods.

    The compiler should handle the integration of non-Smalltalk libraries with Smalltalk code. This has been achieved with the JVM pseudo variable
    and the ability to directly emit bytecodes. Anything the JVM can call you can call.

    The compiler should create JVM Classes in such a way that those classes are usable from non-Smalltalk languages. For example, it should be possible
    to use a Smalltalk class from Java.

    ** Status **: The Smalltalk Compiler is complete.

002. Smalltalk Runtime

    A Smalltalk rumtime should be provided that includes all the classes defined in the "Blue Book" (Smalltalk-80 the language and its implementation)
    with the exception of the graphical classes and those related to threading and scheduling that won't fit the JVM's model of those same concepts.

    The runtime should have a corresponding test suite that covers the functionality of each class to provide some confidence that the runtime is 
    tested and working as expected, and that changes to the runtime do not break existing functionality.

    ** Status **: Underway. Several community members signed up during the class adoption drive to implement a runtime class or two. This process is
    continuing. We need more contributors and or a bigger push to get this completed.

003. Smart Classloader

    A smart classloader which should reload classes when the associated source file changes, and should also 'reload' all classes on request.
    This functionality is essential to enable a quick development feeback loop where source is changed and on next invocation the changed source
    is executed.

    The smart classloader should also be lockable, whereby it will not reload classes nor perform checks to see if the source has changed. The smart 
    classloader is expected to be locked in Production environments.

    There is a current classloader that fits the JVM classloader model, however, these additional features are not 'standard' and will have to be built.

    ** Status **: Underway.
