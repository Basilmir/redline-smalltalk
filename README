Redline Smalltalk is a Smalltalk for the Java Virtual Machine, because nothing is as
productive as Smalltalk, and the App has to run on the Java Virtual Machine.

This is a *very* Alpha Version.  Please read the LICENSE file.

To compile Redline Smalltalk you will need to have Apache Ant installed and on your
path. Then type: "ant" in the Redline Smalltalk root folder and all the classes and
the runtime will be built and packaged into a JAR in the "out" folder.

To compile Smalltalk source files with Redline Smalltalk you use the following
command line (for linux):

java -cp out/redline-smalltalk.jar:lib/dev/asm-all-3.2.jar st.redline.Script <path>

Where <path> is the full path to the smalltalk source. Alteratively if you are on
unix/linux you can run the 'script' tool:

./script <path>

Where <path> is the full path to the smalltalk source. For example:

./script src/main/smalltalk/Object.st

Currently, Redline Smalltalk will put the compiler output into the 'out' folder in
the package st/redline but this will change shortly. Again - this is a *very* Alpha
version.

When you compile a Smalltalk source file there will be a *lot* of trace from the parser
and the compiler, which is to assist in developing and debugging the compiler and 
runtime. At present this can't be turned off.

*end*
